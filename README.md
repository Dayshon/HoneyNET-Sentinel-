# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)

## Introduction

In this project, I set up a mini honeynet in Azure and integrated log sources from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was then used to generate attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the ingested data. I monitored security metrics in the unprotected environment for 24 hours, applied security controls to enhance the environment, and collected metrics for another 24 hours. The following metrics are presented:

- **SecurityEvent** (Windows Event Logs)
- **Syslog** (Linux Event Logs)
- **SecurityAlert** (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- **SecurityIncident** (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL** (Malicious flows allowed into the honeynet)

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was deployed in Microsoft Azure, with log sources integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to trigger alerts and generate incidents based on the collected logs. Performance metrics were captured in the unprotected environment before implementing security controls and again after the controls were in place. A significant reduction in security events and incidents was observed after the security measures were applied, highlighting their effectiveness.

However, it's important to consider that if the network's resources had been more actively used by regular users, the number of security events and alerts within the 24-hour period after the controls were implemented might have been higher.
